- [x] refactor components to be less terrible

in order to make things useful:

- [ ] improve perf by: not displaying over 50 results at once
- [ ] search filenames as well as files (reqs hound modification)
- [ ] debounce search
- [ ] feature parity with hound (search options)
- [ ] code highlights: when in a file with multiple matches, do something to visually separate
- [ ] highlight tokens (e.g. "asdf" search the actual "asdf" gets bolded)
- [ ] deploy configuration
